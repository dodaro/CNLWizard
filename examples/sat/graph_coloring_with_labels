It is required that node with id equal to X is colored with color equal to blue or node with id equal to X is colored with color equal to red or node with id equal to X is colored with color equal to yellow, where X is between 1 and 3 .
If node with id equal to X is colored with color equal to blue, then node with id equal to X cannot be colored with color equal to red and node with id equal to X cannot be colored with color equal to yellow, where X is between 1 and 3 .
If node with id equal to X is colored with color equal to red, then node with id equal to X cannot be colored with color equal to blue and node with id equal to X cannot be colored with color equal to yellow, where X is between 1 and 3 .
If node with id equal to X is colored with color equal to yellow, then node with id equal to X cannot be colored with color equal to red and node with id equal to X cannot be colored with color equal to blue, where X is between 1 and 3 .
If node with id equal to 1 is colored with color equal to X, then node with id equal to 2 cannot be colored with color equal to X and node with id equal to 3 cannot be colored with color equal to X, where X is one of blue, red, yellow.
If node with id equal to 2 is colored with color equal to X, then node with id equal to 1 cannot be colored with color equal to X and node with id equal to 3 cannot be colored with color equal to X, where X is one of blue, red, yellow.
If node with id equal to 3 is colored with color equal to X, then node with id equal to 1 cannot be colored with color equal to X and node with id equal to 2 cannot be colored with color equal to X, where X is one of blue, red, yellow.
