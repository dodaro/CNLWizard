A pathto is identified by first, second.
A node is identified by id.
A connectedto is identified by first, second.
A reachable is identified by id.

There is a connectedto with first equal to 1, with second equal to 2 .
There is a connectedto with first equal to 1, with second equal to 3 .
There is a connectedto with first equal to 2, with second equal to 1 .
There is a connectedto with first equal to 2, with second equal to 4 .
There is a connectedto with first equal to 3, with second equal to 1 .
There is a connectedto with first equal to 3, with second equal to 4 .

start is a constant equal to 1 .
Whenever there is a node with id equal to X, then we can have path with first equal to X, with second equal to Y to a node with id equal to Y, connected with first equal to X, with second equal to Y to.
It is prohibited that there is the number of second that a pathto with first equal to X, with second equal to Y is different from 1 whenever there is a node with id equal to X.
It is prohibited that there is the number of first that a pathto with first equal to X, with second equal to Y is different from 1 whenever there is a node with id equal to Y.
There is a reachable with id equal to start.
Whenever there is a reachable with id equal to X, whenever there is a node with id equal to X, whenever there is a pathto with first equal to X, with second equal to Y, whenever there is a node with id equal to Y, then we must have a reachable with id equal to Y.
It is prohibited that there is not a reachable with id equal to X whenever there is a node with id equal to X.
