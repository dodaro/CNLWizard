It is required that the sum between a queen with id equal to X and X is different from the sum between a queen with id equal to Y and Y, where X is between 1 and 8, where Y is between 1 and 8, where X and Y are distinct.
It is required that the difference between a queen with id equal to X and X is different from the difference between a queen with id equal to Y and Y, where X is between 1 and 8, where Y is between 1 and 8, where X and Y are distinct.
